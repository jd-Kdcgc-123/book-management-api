# Book Management API

Welcome to the Book Management API! This API is designed to facilitate the management of book records through simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Whether you're building a book catalog, managing a library, or creating an online bookstore, this API has you covered.

## Features
- **RESTful API**: Built using NestJS framework, providing a clean and intuitive API interface.
- **Prisma ORM**: Leveraging Prisma for seamless interaction with a SQL database.
- **SQLite Database**: Utilizing SQLite for its simplicity and ease of use, although you can choose any SQL database that fits your requirements.

## Endpoints
The API exposes the following endpoints for managing books:
- **POST /books**: Create a new book.
- **GET /books**: Retrieve a list of books.
- **GET /books/:id**: Retrieve details of a specific book.
- **PUT /books/:id**: Update details of a specific book.
- **DELETE /books/:id**: Delete a specific book.
